# Complex Summation Program

This Python script represents the given mathematical formula:

y = Î£((x^i) + (iy)), where i ranges from 1 to n


The user is prompted to enter values for `x`, `y`, and the last number `n`. The script then calculates and prints the value of `y` based on the summation formula. The loop iterates through the range from 1 to `n`, computing each term of the summation and updating the total sum. The final value of `y` is displayed as the result of the complex summation.
